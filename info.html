        <h2>Earthquake</h2>
        <p>An earthquake is the shaking of the surface of the Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves.</p>
        
        <h4>Safety Measures</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep calm and reassure others.</li>
          <li>During the event, the safest place is an open space, away from buildings.</li>
          <li>If you are indoors, take cover under a desk, table, bed, or doorways and against inside walls and staircase.</li>
        
        </ul>
        <h4>Awareness</h4>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Preparation can cut down on the loss of lives, which is why you should have a plan in place in case there is an earthquake.</li>
          <li>Find safe places in every room of your home and classroom</li>
          <li>Look for safe places inside and outside of other buildings where you spend time.</li>
      </div>
      <div id = "flood">
        <h2>Flood</h2>
        <p>A flood is an overflow of water that submerges land that is usually dry. In the sense of "flowing water", the word may also be applied to the inflow of the tide. Floods are an area of study of the discipline hydrology and are of significant concern in agriculture, civil engineering and public health.</p>
        
        <h4>Safety Measures</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Gather emergency supplies, including food and water.</li>
          <li>Listen to your local radio or television station for updates.</li>
          <li>Have immunization records handy (or know the year of your last tetanus shot).</li>
        
        </ul>
        <h4>Awareness</h4>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Develop an evacuation plan.</li>
          <li>Build a “go” kit of supplies to take with you when evacuating.</li>
          <li>Shut off utility services.</li>
          <li>Protect homes from flooding.</li>
          </ul>
      </div>
      <div id = "tsunami">
        <h2>Tsunami</h2>
        <p>A tsunami is a series of waves in a water body caused by the displacement of a large volume of water, generally in an ocean or a large lake. Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and other underwater explosions above or below water all have the potential to generate a tsunami.</p>
        
        <h4>Safety Measures</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>First, protect yourself from an Earthquake.</li>
          <li>Get to high ground as far inland as possible.</li>
          <li>Be alert to signs of a tsunami, such as a sudden rise or draining of ocean waters.</li>
        
        </ul>
        <h4>Awareness</h4>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Get a NOAA Weather Radio, sign up for text message alerts from your local government</li>
          <li>Rising to several feet or higher.</li>
          <li>Rising to several feet or higher.</li>
          <li>Unusual ocean behavior (the ocean could look like
          a fast-rising flood or a wall of water or it could drain
          away suddenly like a very low, low tide).</li>
          </ul>
      </div>
      <div id = "cyclone">
        <h2>Cyclone</h2>
        <p>In meteorology, a cyclone is a large scale air mass that rotates around a strong center of low atmospheric pressure, counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere as viewed from above. </p>
        
        <h4>Safety Measures</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>In case you need to, wear suitable footwear.</li>
          <li>Stay away from sewerage lines, gutters, drains, culverts, etc.</li>
          <li>Stay away from electric poles and fallen power lines to avoid electrocution.</li>
        
        </ul>
        <h4>Awareness</h4>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Check the house; secure loose tiles, carry out repair works for doors and windows.</li>
          <li>Remove dead woods or dying trees close to the house; anchor removable objects like lumber piles, loose tinsheds, loose bricks, garbage cans, sign-boards etc. which can fly in strong winds.</li>
          <li>Keep some wooden boards ready so that glass windows can be boarded if needed</li>
          <li>Keep a hurricane lantern filled with kerosene, battery operated torches and enough dry cells.</li>
          </ul>
      </div>
      <div id = "drought">
        <h2>Drought</h2>
        <p>A drought is an event of prolonged shortages in the water supply, whether atmospheric, surface water or ground water. A drought can last for months or years, or may be declared after as few as 15 days.</p>
        
        <h4>Safety Measures</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Avoid taking baths.</li>
          <li>Turn on water only to get wet and lather and then again to rinse off.</li>
          <li>Avoid letting the water run while brushing your teeth, washing your face or shaving.</li>
        
        </ul>

          <li>Plant native and/or drought-tolerant grasses, ground covers, shrubs, and trees, or small plants.</li>
          <li>Install irrigation devices that are the most water efficient for each use, such as micro and drip irrigation, and soaker hoses.</li>
          <li>Use mulch to retain moisture in the soil.</li>
